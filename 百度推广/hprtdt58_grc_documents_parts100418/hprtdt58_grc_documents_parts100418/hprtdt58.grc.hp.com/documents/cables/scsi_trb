Noise

The SCSI bus is EXTREMELY SENSITIVE to noise and other aberrations
which may be introduced on the bus.  Noise can be generated by
unterminated cables, cables connected to the bus which are not
connected to a device, or cables which are poorly constructed.  Noise
can also be induced onto the SCSI bus by cables which are improperly
shielded.  Noise induction occurs when strong electrical fields from
external sources penetrate the signal lines of unshielded cables.
While results of noise on the bus are unpredictable, they typcally
result in corruption of data which is being transferred from one
device to another on the bus.  Cables which conform to the SCSI XT39
specification must be used in order to avoid noise problems.  All
SCSI cables available from Hewlett Packard meet or exceed the
requirements specified in XT39.  Care must be taken to ensure that
non-HP cables which are connected to the bus also meet XT39.

NOTE:  Devices attached to the bus are also a potential source of
noise generation on the bus.  Device noise generation is discussed in
SCSI Engineering Note Vol 1.6.


Cable Terminology


LD = low density- The LD male connector looks like a large Centronics
     connector

HD = high density- The HD male connector looks similar to an RS-232
     connector except that it is not as tall and it has 50 pins.

MM= male/male

M/F = male/female

Cable Lengths

The SCSI bus consists of all cables and devices which are connected
to the bus.  The cable limitation for the SCSI bus is 6 meters
maximum, which includes both cable lengths external as well as
internal to the device.  The minimum cable length recommended for
connecting devices to the SCSI bus is .5 (1/2) meter.


Listed below are examples of devices which contain internal cable
length.

Calculating Cable Lengths

Prior to configuring devices on the SCSI bus, the total cable length
of the proposed configuration must be determined.  Follow the
sequence detailed below in order to calculate cable lengths:

1.  Recall that the total length of the SCSI bus calculation must
    include both internal and external device cable lengths.  The
    first activity is to determine the total length of cable within
    the device.  The device is defined as anything that can be
    connected to the SCSI bus including embedded peripheral systems
    and external peripherals.

    NOTE:  Embedded peripheral systems are defined as those systems
    which house peripherals within the system cabinet.  (ie:  8X2/9X2
    and 8X7/9X7 systems).

2.  If the system contains embedded peripherals, subtract the total
    internal cable length from the 6 meter maximum.  (ie:  827 system
    has 3 meters of internal cable.  6 meter maximum minus 3 meters
    internal equals available cable length of 3 meters.  The three
    meter value is the length of cable available for attaching other
    periperals to the bus.

3.  If the system does not utilize embedded peripherals the total
    available cable length which may be attached to a SCSI interface
    is 6 meters.

    NOTE:  The next activity involves the art of creative compromize.
    Physical layout of the system and external peripheral devices has
    a significant impact on the length of the bus.  The further away
    the peripheral device is placed from the system, the longer the
    interface cable.  The longer the interface cable, the fewer
    number of pheripherals which may be connected to the bus.

4.  Consider that each peripheral will typically be connected to the
    bus with a 1 meter or 1.5 meter cable.  Estimate the number of
    peripheral devices (including connecting cable) which can be
    connected to the bus while remaining within the 6 meter maximum
    length.

    ie:  If there 3 meters of available cable length remaining then;
         a.  Two peripheral devices with zero internal cable lengths
             may be connected using two 1.5 meter cables

                               -or-

	 b.  Three peripheral devices with zero internal cable
	     lengths may be connected using three 1 meter cables.

Serial Connection of Devices

SCSI supports only Serial connections of devices onto the external
SCSI bus.  Serial connections are sometimes referred to as "daisy
chain", that is they are daisy chained from one device on the bus to
the next device on the bus.  The following example illustrates a
physical implementation of Serial connection:


1.  The first physical cable connected to the SCSI bus interface PCA
    will be referred to as the point of origin.  The first cable
    connected to the point of origin must be connected directly to
    the first peripheral device to be attached to the SCSI bus.

2.  The next physical cable connected to the bus must be between the
    first peripheral device SCSI connector and the second peripheral
    device SCSI connector.

3.  The next physical cable connected to the bus must be between the
    second peripheral device SCSI connector and the third peripheral
    device SCSI connector.

4.  Continue connection of cables and peripheral devices in daisy
    chain fashion until all devices are connected to the bus.
