Other Notes:

    Please note that to fully support this tape drive the following patch must be
    added to the operating system on the server: 

    PHKL_29035 for HP-UX 11.i (PA-RISC)


   The lab has created 11.00 and 11.11 versions of a new stape
   patch that is supposed to address this issue.
   
   The patch IDs are


   [PHKL_29247/PACHRDME/English]  - 11.00  stape patch
   [PHKL_29248/PACHRDME/English]  - 11.11  stape patch

   [PHKL_29093/PACHRDME/English]    11.00 cumulative SCSI ultra160
   [PHKL_29035  		    11.11 cumulative SCSI ultra 160

   Target Initiated Negotiation Issue with DAT 40 and DAT 72 Tape Drives
   
   The DAT40 and DAT72 tape drives includes Target Initiated Negotiation functionality

   HP-UX fails to see tape drives attached to the following HBA’s:

• HP A6828A - PA-RISC and IA-64 platform Single Channel Ultra 160 HBA
• HP A6829A - PA-RISC and IA-64 platform   Dual Channel Ultra 160 HBA

Note:  Target Initiated Negotiation is part of the Universal SCSI Specification
       and is likely to be implemented in all future HP tape drives.

Solution :
      There are patches available, for the HP-UX tape driver (scsi_c8xx.o),
      to address the issue.  The patch numbers are as follows:

      HP-UX 11.0      PHKL_29093
      HP-UX 11.11     PHKL_29035
      HP-UX 11.23     pending - should come with the updated tape driver at install
